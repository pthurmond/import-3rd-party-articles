# import-3rd-party-articles
This is where I take posts found on social media or on websites I question the longevity of and store articles and posts that seem like good or important reads. It can be important due to being informative or as a cautionary tale. The views in these articles may or may not reflect my own perspectives. There is value in different perspectives.
