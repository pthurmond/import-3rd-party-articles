# Important 3rd Party Articles
This is where I take posts found on social media or on websites I question the longevity of and store articles and posts that seem like good or important reads. It can be important due to being informative or as a cautionary tale. The views in these articles may or may not reflect my own perspectives. There is value in different perspectives.

We should strive to not live in an echo chamber nor let fear prevent us from challenging troubling or problematic statements and ideologies. We also should attempt to learn from perspectives that we differ with, including those that we find abhorrent because it reveals more about humanity, culture, and our place in this world. It can also be a tool to prevent terrible things from happening again.
